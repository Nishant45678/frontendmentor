### What I learned


I learned to use CSS variables (:root custom properties) to store common values like colors. This improved code maintainability by allowing me to change colors in one place, which cascades across the whole stylesheet.


```
:root {
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --slate-300: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --slate-500: hsl(216, 15%, 48%);
  --slate-900: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```
Flexbox was incredibly useful for centering the entire card vertically and horizontally within the viewport, making the layout responsive and visually appealing on different screen sizes.

```
.card-body {
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```
